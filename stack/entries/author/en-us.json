He served an apprenticeship with a printer and then worked as a typesetter, contributing articles to the newspaper of his older brother Orion Clemens. He later became a riverboat pilot on the Mississippi River before heading west to join Orion in Nevada. He referred humorously to his lack of success at mining, turning to journalism for the Virginia City Territorial Enterprise. His humorous story, \"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\", was published in 1865, based on a story that he heard at Angels Hotel in Angels Camp, California, where he had spent some time as a miner. The short story brought international attention and was even translated into French. His wit and satire, in prose and in speech, earned praise from critics and peers, and he was a friend to presidents, artists, industrialists, and European royalty.","tags":[],"locale":"en-us","ACL":{},"uid":"blt75acf90cd5678d01","created_at":"2022-02-21T05:57:33.352Z","updated_at":"2022-02-21T05:57:33.352Z","_version":1,"_in_progress":false,"publish_details":[{"environment":"blt37a5d3280ca7d398","locale":"en-us","time":"2022-02-21T05:58:07.953Z","version":1},{"environment":"bltb9d8c6b0b2cf6ea4","locale":"en-us","time":"2022-02-21T05:58:07.961Z","version":1},{"environment":"bltfd7f249ca55fdd81","locale":"en-us","time":"2022-02-21T05:58:07.969Z","version":1}]},"bltad6f7c1e5ed02e26":{"title":"Virginia Woolf","picture":{"uid":"blt78cc3ebb1bd175d3","created_at":"2022-02-21T05:56:38.925Z","updated_at":"2022-02-21T05:56:38.925Z","content_type":"image/jpeg","file_size":"21371","tags":[],"filename":"Virginia_Woolf_Headshot.jpg","url":"https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/<api_key>/<asset_uid>/<entity_uid>/<asset_name>","ACL":[],"is_dir":false,"parent_uid":"blt3c20f6bb8b1fe0f3","_version":1,"title":"Virginia Woolf","description":"","publish_details":[{"environment":"blt37a5d3280ca7d398","locale":"fr-fr","time":"2022-02-21T05:56:40.430Z","version":1},{"environment":"bltb9d8c6b0b2cf6ea4","locale":"fr-fr","time":"2022-02-21T05:56:40.437Z","version":1},{"environment":"bltfd7f249ca55fdd81","locale":"fr-fr","time":"2022-02-21T05:56:40.443Z","version":1},{"environment":"blt37a5d3280ca7d398","locale":"en-us","time":"2022-02-21T05:56:40.452Z","version":1},{"environment":"bltb9d8c6b0b2cf6ea4","locale":"en-us","time":"2022-02-21T05:56:40.458Z","version":1},{"environment":"bltfd7f249ca55fdd81","locale":"en-us","time":"2022-02-21T05:56:40.464Z","version":1}]},"bio":"Woolf was born into an affluent household in South Kensington, London, the seventh child in a blended family of eight which included the modernist painter Vanessa Bell.
